        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Chris Rabuse, a 20 year old Full Stack Developer. I currently live in Minnesota, just north of the Twin Cities. In
my free time I work on a variety of side projects such as graphic design and indie game development. I enjoy crafting interactive
experiences while pushing the limits of my knowledge and learning new skills. I also enjoy the outdoors whenever possible
with photography, snowmobiling, boating and fishing</p>
