        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Software Engineer creating full stack solutions for customer-facing applications at Reemo Health, 
          a digital health company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When I am not writing software, I spend time practicing 
          guitar, reading science fiction and fantasy books, and depending upon the time of the year I can be found up 
          north hitting the trails on snowmobile or enjoying time on a lake.

          <h2>Reemo Health Portal</h2>
          <p class="time-frame">July 2017 - Current</p>
          <p>The portal is designed to be used by wearers of a Reemo Health Device (Samsung Gear S2) and senior living facilities to view and 
            share access to health information captured by the devices sensors. The portal is built with Angular 5 and consumes the Reemo Health REST API.

          <h2>Reemo Health Early Standalone Watch UI</h2>
          <p class="time-frame">April 2017 - June 2017</p>
          <p>
            The very first iteration of the Reemo Health standalone watch UI was a suite of applications for the Tizen
            operating system that would capture heart rate and step count data and send it to the Reemo Health cloud services.
            The UI consisted of a watch face, three Tizen Web Widgets (Heart Rate, Step Count and Battery), Remote PERS (Emergency Call) and a parent
            application that was responsible for capturing the data, updating the widgets and sending the data through
            an IPC call to a native Tizen service. The visual design of the UI was completely my own with and focused on
            usability for seniors. This meant that text had to be as big as possible and have very few touch targets on 
            the small 1.2 inch, 360 x 360 pixel OLED display. All of the applications were written in TypeScript, HTML and SCSS using the Tizen OS JavaScript API.

          <p>
            The very first iteration of a user dashboard for facilities. The UI showed a sortable list of users that were
            by default sorted by priority as determined by data from Samsung S-Health gathered from a Samsung smart phone
            paired with a Samsung Galaxy S2 smart watch. The dashboard was written using Angular 2 with the Teradata 
            Covalent UI platform and consumed an external API built on Azure Functions.
